## Description

Create a function with two arguments that will return an array of the first `n` multiples of `x`. 

Assume both the given number and the number of times to count will be positive numbers greater than `0`. 

Return the results as an array or list ( depending on language ).

### Examples

```cpp
countBy(1,10)  should return  {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}
countBy(2,5)  should return {2,4,6,8,10}
```
```java
countBy(1,10)  // should return  {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}
countBy(2,5)  // should return {2,4,6,8,10}
```
```javascript
countBy(1,10) === [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
countBy(2,5) === [2,4,6,8,10]
```
